## ✅ Step 2 – Master Core Topics (with SQL)

### 🧠 Core Algorithm & Coding Topics

#### Arrays and Strings
- Sliding Window, Two Pointers  
- Subarrays and substrings with given properties  
- Prefix sums and difference arrays 
- Array binary search and bubble sort

#### Hash Maps and Sets
- Frequency counting  
- Duplicate detection  
- Optimizing lookups and counts  

#### Recursion and Backtracking
- Generate permutations, combinations  
- Subset problems  
- Constraint-based search (e.g., Sudoku solver)  

#### Dynamic Programming
- Memoization vs. tabulation  
- Subset sum, Knapsack, Longest common subsequence  
- Staircase/climbing problems  

#### Graphs
- Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Connected components  
- Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)  

#### Trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
- Traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder)  
- Binary tree depth problems  
- Lowest common ancestor, tree serialization  

#### Design-Level Data Structures
- **LRU Cache** using HashMap + Doubly Linked List  
- LFU Cache (optional but good for deeper prep)  
- Understand class-based design and O(1) operations  

#### Heaps and Priority Queues
- Top K frequent elements  
- Merging K sorted arrays/lists  
- Heap-based scheduling or interval problems

### 🗃️ SQL Topics (-Relevant)

> ’s SQL challenges tend to be data-heavy, analytical, and based on real-world business cases. You may be asked to write multi-step queries based on complex schemas.

#### 📌 Focus Topics

##### SELECT Queries with Joins
- Inner joins, left/right joins  
- Joining 3+ tables  
- Join filtering and aliasing  

##### Filtering and Aggregations
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `WHERE`  
- Window functions (e.g., `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`)  
- Conditional aggregations with `CASE WHEN`  

##### Subqueries
- Correlated vs non-correlated subqueries  
- Filtering using subqueries (e.g., top performers, recent records)  

##### Window Functions
- `OVER(PARTITION BY ...)` for rankings, cumulative sums, lag/lead  
- Moving averages, running totals  

##### Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
- Break down complex queries  
- Recursive CTEs (rare, but good bonus)  

##### Data Cleaning & Deduplication
- Identify duplicates with `ROW_NUMBER()` or `COUNT(*)`  
- Handling NULLs, filtering invalid data
